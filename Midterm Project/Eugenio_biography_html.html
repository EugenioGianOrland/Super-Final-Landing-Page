                Hi, I’m Gian Orland Eugenio.<sup>(1)</sup> And this turned out to be my story from my childhood years.<sup>(2)</sup> The most memorable incident that happened to me when I was young.<sup>(3)</sup> When I was playing Tumbang Preso with my friends and I was the guard at the can.<sup>(4)</sup> And then a can hit me on the head and then they called my parents because they said I was dizzy.<sup>(5)</sup> They almost take me to the hospital because there is already blood.<sup>(6)</sup> And another incident for me that I will never forget is when I was a child, when we went to the mall to go shopping because I was a child, right?<sup>(7)</sup> My cousin who was watching over me said that I was very ugly. <sup>(8)</sup> Then after a few minutes I was running. <sup>(9)</sup> I suddenly disappeared and they couldn't find me. <sup>(10)</sup> I just cried on one side and a cashier approached me and even announced at the mall that a child was missing. <sup>(11)</sup> And I still don't know what my name is because I'm only about 2 or 3 years old. <sup>(12)</sup> They seem so nervous mommy because I'm missing. <sup>(13)</sup> Then when they heard the announcement that there was such a child who was said to be missing, they hurried to go there, and my cousin who was watching over me was ashamed because he had neglected me at that time.<sup>(14)</sup> From then on, they never left me and never lost sight of me every time we went to the mall.<sup>(15)</sup> Another thing I can't forget when I was young was at Christmas, Simbang gabi then and my parents said that I had to complete the 9 Simbang gabi. <sup>(16)</sup> And then after that I completed it because the wish would come true, so after the ninth that night. <sup>(17)</sup> The next day it was Christmas and what I asked for came true, that I buy a remote control car, I was so happy because I had no idea that only mommy and daddy bought it.<sup>(18)</sup> From the beginning, I always complete the Simbang gabi and I gradually realized that they are the only mommy who puts gifts under our Christmas tree.<sup>(19)</sup> So I don't know how I'm going to feel non because it's a mixture of joy, fun, and surprise because I was surprised that I thought the gift came from god but I realized that god used mommy and daddy to be the instrument to give me the gift which I ask for every Christmas.<sup>(20)</sup> Those are the only things I remember when I was young. <sup>(21)</sup>

                During my teenage years, one of the most memorable was my high school life.<sup>(1)</sup> Almost all of the unexpected events in my life that I experienced here.<sup>(2)</sup> Let's start with love life, here I first had a girlfriend, I was grade 6 or grade 7 that time.<sup>(3)</sup> Then the story of that started to bully and ended up in the one we liked.<sup>(4)</sup> From grade 5 to grade 7 I only studied in Bulacan, but from grade 8 until now I have been studying in UE.<sup>(5)</sup> I thought from grade 5 to grade 7 high school life was fun.<sup>(6)</sup> Since we went to manila here, I really tried everything, I tried not to enter but it was wrong.<sup>(7)</sup> I just really tried, that's how I feel.<sup>(8)</sup> My mother is very helpful especially professor at UE so I'm very afraid that I might get caught of the guard and report me to my mom. <sup>(9)</sup> And that was probably the most serious sin I committed when I was in high school.<sup>(10)</sup> Then I was sad because of all the schools I went to in Bulacan.<sup>(11)</sup> I just didn't experience a fieldtrip in UE, I'm very sorry because they said that the school isn't happy if I haven't experienced a field trip but at least I'll try they are in Bulacan.<sup>(12)</sup> It's a pity I didn't try them in manila.<sup>(13)</sup> Because my classmates said that's why there is no such thing in UE because there was an incident that happened that a child died on the fieldtrip so they didn't use it or they deleted the fieldtrip from the extracurricular activities of the school.<sup>(14)</sup> The happiest thing that happened to me was every time there was a Christmas party.<sup>(15)</sup> Because after the party my friends and I would go for a walk, sometimes we would go to the star city or go to the mall to eat.<sup>(16)</sup> I only experienced those here because in Bulacan there is nowhere to go and there are only a few malls in our area.<sup>(17)</sup> Another thing I remember when I was in high school in ue was when the harlem shake was in vogue, my crazy classmates made a video on cr and the mess they made was so bad the janitor was very angry that day because he just finished cleaning after we made the vid it was full of clutter, it's a good thing we didn't report to the guidance and we just apologized to the janitor.<sup>(18)</sup> Then another thing that happened to me in high school is the high school graduation of course. <sup>(19)</sup> My parents bought my wish, iphone.<sup>(20)</sup> I was so happy that day because they bought me, I used to only dream of having such a phone but now not because I already have it hahaha but after a few years I still like it better use android phones because I'm more used to it.<sup>(21)</sup> after graduation is college life and that story will be told in the next paragraph thanks.<sup>(22)</sup> That's all I remember from high school.<sup>(23)</sup>

            When I was in high school, I thought that was the most difficult thing to study.<sup>(1)</sup> But since I went to college, here I have experienced everything a student can experience.<sup>(2)</sup> By the way, my course was Civil Engineering because my classmates said that we would study together and that we would work together until we graduated.<sup>(3)</sup> But I really don't want Civil Engineering but I reached the 3rd year but I'm an irregular student.<sup>(4)</sup> It's just the beginning, I just didn't realize that I'm not happy with what I'm doing and it's not really what I want, that's my mistake.<sup>(5)</sup> I should before I choose a course, think first.<sup>(6)</sup> It really should be good so that I don't have to move around and don't waste time.<sup>(7)</sup> So that's why, I searched for things I want to do that I have in college.<sup>(8)</sup> My 3rd option is BSIT but this is my choice, apart from having credited subjects, I'm also a bit fond of computer parts and computers themselves.<sup>(9)</sup> I thought that's all I would do in the BSIT course.<sup>(10)</sup> I was shocked that there were programming languages to study.<sup>(11)</sup> But I said they don't, if you really want something you can do what you can learn from it.<sup>(12)</sup> Right now I'm a 3rd year and still want to learn more.<sup>(13)</sup> I hope this is really the one for me because I don't want to look or choose or move to another course because I'm running out of time.<sup>(14)</sup> I deeply regret the time I wasted.<sup>(15)</sup> In college since I became college, I have learned so much as a student, first you have nothing else to do but study, you have to finish no matter what happens.<sup>(16)</sup> Second there is no permanent friend in college.<sup>(17)</sup> But you will really get to know the real friends who will stay with you even if you know that you will no longer be in the same class, they are still your friends.<sup>(18)</sup> That's all and nothing else. <sup>(19)</sup> I would also like to add that that's why I studied at UE because Mom is a professor here and this is a big help to our family because my Mom gets an educational benefit and we were given the opportunity to study at the University of the East.<sup>(20)</sup> So we were very lucky with our parents because they were given an opportunity like this that we were able to study at a university. <sup>(21)</sup> And this I will not waste to make up for my parents.<sup>(22)</sup> Thank you very much That's all.<sup>(23)</sup>
