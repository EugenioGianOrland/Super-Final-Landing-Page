    <p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferred song genres are the following, Opm, K-Pop and techno or EDM
        That's why I liked opm because of the Filipino artists who made you famous or showed off their singing talent. one of my favorite artists today on OPM are Arthur Nery and Zack Tabudlo, That's why I liked their songs because I can relate to their songs a bit.
        
        Next was K-Pop, my passion for kpop started when I saw Jennie Kim of Blackpink on a facebook page. At first, I said that she was nice, I listened to their songs, then I was beautiful because the beat is nice even though I don't understand the words the next K-Pop group I liked was Twice, because their songs are also good. The latest is Techno or EDM, it started when I attended UE manila Powhiri in 2014 or 2015 if I'm not mistaken. since then i have been fond of EDM music below is the list of songs

                It exemplifies Filipino culture. OPM is the Filipino people's beating heart. It appeals to the Filipino people's hearts and brains, and it demonstrates how brilliant Filipinos are in the music business. OPM is unique in that it was created by us and symbolizes us, the Filipinos.

                The series, which aired from 2005 to 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in the year 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother.

                The honest and realistic characters, in my opinion, are what set this program apart from others like it. Ted Mosby, the hopeless romantic, is introduced early on. He simply wants to meet his soulmate with whom he can marry and have children, and who does he fall in love with at first sight? Robin Scherbatsky is a strong, independent woman who not only isn't adept at relationships, but also refuses to marry or have children. It's not only a great way to create suspense in the program, but it's also a good reflection of actual life. How many of us can say we've fallen in love with someone who isn't a good match for our goals in life? Or how many of us can state that we don't want what traditional society demands and have no intention of changing? The show's creators, Craig Thomas and Carter Bays, understood exactly what they were doing when they developed this combination.

                Born and raised in Cagayan De Oro, Arthur Nery was always into music since he was young. In fact, music actually runs in the family as his parents are singers. He credits them for inspiring him to make music.

                Pop music would be nothing without catchy hooks and sing-along lyrics. K pop is no different, making use of melodies that are instantly stuck in your head. Boy and girl groups alike have appealing song writing down to a science, which makes their music appealing to fans no matter what language they speak.

                Although music is a subjective experience, most EDM fans praise this type of music for its complex rhythms, upbeat energy, danceability, and unconventionality. For EDM lovers, it's more than just club music. It's a feeling and a way of life you have to explore to understand.
