            This paragraph contains the skills I have.<sup>(1)</sup> First let's start with Critical thinking and problem solving.<sup>(2)</sup> I became a civil engineering student and here I used this skill.<sup>(3)</sup> Because of engineering, this is really what you need.<sup>(4)</sup> So, I shifted the course because I knew it wasn't really for me.<sup>(5)</sup> So, I shifted To I.T.<sup>(6)</sup> My next skill is Teamwork and collaboration.<sup>(7)</sup> So, I  said that this is one of my abilities.<sup>(8)</sup> Because whenever there is a group project, I am usually the chosen leader.<sup>(9)</sup> Here I have proven that it is really difficult to do a group activity if you are the only one who wants to finish right away.<sup>(10)</sup> My next skill is having time management.<sup>(11)</sup> Because I have so much to do but I can still do it at the right time.<sup>(12)</sup> Like this activity.<sup>(13)</sup> 10PM I started working because too much to actually do.<sup>(14)</sup> I haven't inserted it before.<sup>(15)</sup> Ultimately my skill is to have self -discipline.<sup>(16)</sup> I proved this by my weight loss.<sup>(17)</sup> Last August, my weight was 105kg<sup>(18)</sup> And this February, my weight is only 75.<sup>(19)</sup> So, it's so much fun to feel that you can see the results of what you have worked for.<sup>(20)</sup> Those are the only skills I can share.<sup>(21)</sup> There are many more but it is over 20 sentences.<sup>(22)</sup> So that's what I'm going to do in the next paragraph<sup>(23)</sup>
